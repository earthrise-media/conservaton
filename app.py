	## Next steps
	There are a lot of other views and metrics that may be useful.

	1. **Optimization dashboard**.  Basically a way to construct and monitor a
	portfolio of concessions based on Earth observation data.  This sort of
	dashboard will also help to report on dimensions like _Permanence_ or
	_Additionality_ for selected concessions &mdash; interventions yield outcomes that
	are off-baseline.

	2. **Metrics for 'nearby' areas**. Comparison of protected area metrics
	against other areas.  The concept of 'nearby' can be based on geographic, or
	another measure of similarity. Statistical matching has been used in academic
	studies to demonstrate the [efficacy of multiple use protected
	areas](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0022722).

	3. **Higher spatial and temporal resolution**.  Some measures are daily,
	through yesterday.  Some are annual.  For those, more up-to-date measures can
	be derived, but that would require a lot more work.

	4. **Additional datasets**.  Including building outlines and other
	infrastructure, as well as land use.  weather anomalies and climate
	(mitigate, proactively, the impact of climate change.)
